# Multi-motif analysis

This repo contain all analysis for the paper entitled "Community level individual-based plant-pollinator networks unveil pollen flow dynamics and plant reproductive success" by several members of Radical Community Ecology, where we study different macro-, meso- and microstructural descriptors of individual-based community-wide plant-pollinator multilayer networks, and their effect on the reproductive success of the plant individuals. To do so, we downscaled the analysis of interactions based on motifs to the level of conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals.

* Raw data on pollination, fitness and competition at Caracoles can be found in the folder `Raw_Data/`
* Processed data (such as the layers of our networks, the data we used to feed our models, or the results of our null model calculations) can be found in the folder `Processed_data/`
* Functions can be found in the folder `R_Scripts/`

You can find below examples on how to calculate (i) modules and centrality metrics, as well as (ii) the total amount of homospecific and heterospecific triplets per week and pollinator. To run the examples, you need install the infomapecology package by S. Pilosof, C. Farage, and D. Edler. You can find the Infomap installation guide [here](https://github.com/Ecological-Complexity-Lab/infomap_ecology_package).

# Calculating modules and centrality metrics: An example.

To run the this example I will use the functions in `R_Scripts/functions.R` and the data in `Example/example.csv`. The metadata in `Example/example.csv` can be described as follows:
* Plot: network/site/year ID.
* Subplot: plant individual ID.
* Plant: plant species ID.
* ID: visitor species ID.
* Visits: number of visits recorded between the plant individual and the visitor species.
* Week: week number.

In the figure below we show the information in `Example/example.csv`.

We will obtain the following information:
* Real_PR_Multi: the PageRank index, whose value represents the probability of finding a grain of pollen (that diffuses on the system) in a given node, after a long time. This variable provides the PageRank value when the multilayer is coupled. 
* Real_PR_Layer: the PageRank value when the layers are isolated.
* StrengthIn: the in-stregth of a node.
* StrengthOut: the out-stregth of a node.
* DegreeIn: the in-degree of a node.
* DegreeOut: the out-degree of a node.
* Delta: Real_PR_Multi - Real_PR_Layer
* Ratio: Real_PR_Multi / Real_PR_Layer

# Calculating the total amount of homospecific and heterospecific triplets per week and pollinator: An example.

Given a network, we can decompose it into smaller subgraphs, called motifs. Here we estimated the amount of undirected triplets that were present in our visitation networks, that is, the pattern of connections of undirected path graphs with length 2 (see panels a and b in the figure above). In addition, we restricted our analysis to triplets with two plant individuals. 

One novel aspect of our work consisted in downscaling the analysis of interactions based on motifs to the level of conspecific and heterospecific plant individuals. Here we introduced a new triplet classification according to the plant species involved. If both focal plants belong to the same species, the triplet was referred to as homospecific motif (see the bee's motif that is highlighted in panel b); otherwise, the motif was classified as heterospecific (see the butterfly's motif that is highlighted in panel b).

To incorporate speciesâ€™ phenological overlap in our motif analysis, we calculated both types of triplets from the bipartite networks that arose weekly (see panel a for an example of such networks). Thus, heterospecific triplets only appear when different coflowering species that shared pollinators are present in a given week. Here, we show how to estimate total amount of homo- and of heterospecific triplets per week and floral visitor for a given plant.

To run the this example I will use again the functions in `R_Scripts/functions.R` and the data in `Example/example.csv`. See the example above for additional information on the `Example/example.csv`.
